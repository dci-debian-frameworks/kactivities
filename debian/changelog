kactivities (4:4.10.0-0r0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer ]
  * Add myself to Uploaders.

  [ Daniele E. Domenichelli ]
  * Update build dependencies:
    + Bump kdelibs5-dev to 4:4.10.
    + Add libx11-dev.
    + Add libqt4-opengl-dev.
  * Update installed files.
  * Update symbols.

  [ José Manuel Santamaría Lema ]
  * Bump kde-sc-dev-latest build dependency to 4:4.10.0.
  * Build depend on nepomuk-core-dev >= 4:4.10.
  * In order to avoid a circular dependency between libkactivities-bin and
    libkactivities6 (this didn't happen in 4.8.x):
    + libkactivities6.symbols adds a dependency on libkactivities-bin (and added
      a lintian override for symbols-declares-dependency-on-other-package).
    + libkactivities6 recommends libkactivities-bin to avoid possible partial
      upgrades problems.
  * Add libkactivities-models1 package.
  * Use ${allLibraries} variables for libkactivities-dev and libkactivities-dbg
    depends.
  * Bump build dependency on pkg-kde-tools to 0.15.4~, because previous releases
    wouldn't filter out libkactivities-dbg from ${allLibraries}.
  * Update installed files.
  * Update symbols files.
